PROJECT NAME:

Credit Card Fraud Detection using machine learning

PROJECT DESCRIPTION :

This repository contains Credit card fraud detection algorithm using machine learning techniques in python.

**_Credit Card Fraud Detection_** : With a lot of people, banks and online retailer being a victim of credit card fraud, a model detecting whether the transaction is fraud or not
									
**_Algorithm_** : The algorithm used in this dataset is Random Forest algorithm.
		For model improvement normalization and SMOTE techniques (to handle imbalanced data) were used. 
		 Pediction,Classification done in this project

**_Visualisation_** : The library used for visualizing the data, confusion matrix etc. is seaborn.

This code is prepared using Jupyter Notebook.
